# What to expect from the class.

First, hello, and welcome to the class.

During the first class session of a normal semester I usually say something like "I think you will find this course challenging but a lot of fun." The 'challenging' part will be doubly true this semester as we are adjusting to an online course. But I am hoping we don't lose sight of the 'fun' aspect of the course.

The first time I taught an online course was over 25 years ago when I taught Introduction to Computational Linguistics for the Linguistics Department at the University of Minnesota while I was working in a computational linguistics lab and living in New Mexico. This semester I still am living in New Mexico (Santa Fe) and will help guide you through the course material wherever you are situated whether it is in Virginia or elsewhere.  (Keep in mind that I am on Mountain TIme!)

## Videos and Interactive notebooks and projects

The content of the course is in the form of  video screencasts from the [Inquiryum Machine Learning Fundamentals Course](http://inquiryum.com/machine-learning/) and interactive Python notebooks. These are described a bit in the class syllabus but let me elaborate.

### Video Screencasts

The videos often come in pairs: One video explains the theory of an algorithm the other is a hands-on one where I talk through how to code and use the algorithm. For example, there is a video on how a decision tree algorithm works. In the next video I show you how to code a decision tree classifier in Python. 

### Interactive Jupyter Notebooks

For each pair of videos, there is an associated interactive notebook that covers the same material using different examples. So if the video was unclear, hopefully the notebook will make it more clear. The syllabus describes the notebooks, which I also call labs, as:

* In the form of Jupyter Notebook tutorials which provide detailed explanations and sample executable code. 
* You are to:
  * write a small amount of code to complete the task
  * answer any non-coding questions the Notebook may ask.

The notebooks are designed to be a step-by-step guide to some topic. You will submit the notebook for points. There are approximately 15 of these notebooks.

###  Projects

After we finish a module of these video/notebook topics, you will be working on a project. The projects are underspecified, meaning I don't give you detailed instructions of what to do. You can see the instructions to the first project [here](https://github.com/zacharski/ml-class/blob/master/projects/Bach.md). It is your chance to apply what you learned in the module. These are also submitted for points. 

### Review Papers

In your professional career you will learn new techniques by examining the work of others. To help you get started with this you will be looking at Jupyter notebooks others have created to solve various problems. You will pick one of these and write a 2 page paper about it. More details will be provided. The requirement is to do two of these papers.



## Zoom Study Groups

I want the course to be more than just you working through online material on your own alone in your room. I would like the feeling to be that we are in this together and have the ability to get help quickly from people. My son told me that during this coronavirus time, his work group starts the day with a Zoom Scrum standup and then keeps Zoom up while they work all day. That way, if someone has a question, they can get an instant answer. People mute, go to the bathroom, come back, get something to eat, comeback, but there is this sense of connection--they are working together on a common project. I thought that sounded fantastic and decided to implement this idea in Zoom study groups as follows 

* The study groups are on Tuesday. 
* Each study group is 1.5 hours long
* The group starts with a Scrum Standup. That means we go around the group and answer these questions:
  * what did I do since the last meeting
  * what will I work on today
  * are there any impediments in my way?
* After the standup we just work on our stuff for the remainder of our time while staying in the zoom call.
* If you have a question you can ask it and get help from anyone in the group including me.
* There is a 8 person limit to how many people can be in a group. While I determine the membership of each group, you can request to be in a group with specific people and I will try to honor that request.

These study groups are optional, but if you wish to participate you will receive a 10% bonus on all work provided you attend 75% of the study groups.  If you wish to commit to this, there is a section on our [signup form](https://forms.gle/GrBgG96H92NQP7kk9)
