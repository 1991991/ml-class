# What to expect from the class.

First, hello, and welcome to the class.

During the first class session of a normal semester I usually say something like "I think you will find this course challenging but a lot of fun." The 'challenging' part will be doubly true this semester as we are adjusting to an online course. But I am hoping we don't lose sight of the 'fun' aspect of the course.

The first time I taught an online course was over 25 years ago when I taught Introduction to Computational Linguistics for the Linguistics Department at the University of Minnesota while I was working in a computational linguistics lab and living in New Mexico. This semester I still am living in New Mexico (Santa Fe) and will help guide you through the course material wherever you are situated whether it is in Virginia or elsewhere. 

## Videos and Interactive notebooks

The content of the course is in the form of  video screencasts and interactive Python notebooks. 

### Video Screencasts

The videos often come in pairs: One video explains the theory of an algorithm the other is a hands-on one where I talk through how to code and use the algorithm. For example, there is a video on how a decision tree algorithm works. In the next video I show you how to code a decision tree classifier in Python. 



### Interactive Jupyter Notebooks

For each pair of videos, there is an associated interactive notebook that covers the same material using different examples. So if the video was unclear, hopefully the notebook will make it more clear. Or vice versa. You will submit the notebook for points. After we finish a module of these video/notebook topics, you will be working on a project. The projects are underspecified meaning I don't give you detailed instructions of what to do. It is your chance to apply what you learned in the module. These are also submitted for points. In your professional career you will learn new techniques by examining the work of others. 

But I want the course to be more than just you working through online material.
