    "In the examples we have been working with so far, all the columns had numerical data. For example, the violet classification data looked like:\n",

    "Notice that all the feature columns had numeric data. In addition to **numeric** data datasets often contain **categorical data**. A column that contains **categorical data** means that the values are from a limited set of values. For example:\n",

    "Here, the genre and rating columns contains categorical data meaning that the values of those columns are not numeric and they are from a limited set of possibilities. Modern machine learning algorithms are designed to handle numeric data and, as a preprocessing step, we will need to convert the categorical columns to numeric. One solution would be simply to convert each category to an integer. So drama is 1, documentary 2 etc:\n",

    "Numeric columns like `Tomato Rating` and `Length` are fine as is but categorical columns (`Genre` and `Rating`) are problematic for machine learning. Simply converting the category values to integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "But this solution is problematic. Integers infer  both an ordering and a distance where 2 is closer to 1 than 4. Since in the genre column 1 is drama, 2 is documentary, and 4 is action, our scheme implies that dramas are closer to documentaries than they are to action films, which is clearly not the case. This problem also exists in the rating column. **So clearly this method is not the way to go**!\n",

    "Ant Man and the Wasp  |  88 | Science Fiction | PG-13 | 118\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, we had the categorical column rating with the possible values drama, documentary, animation, action, comedy and science fiction. Instead of one column with those values, we are going to convert it to a form where each value is its own column. If that instance is of that value then we would put a **one** in that column, otherwise we would put a zero. So we would convert\n",
