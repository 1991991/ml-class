# Machine Learning Fundamentals Course




## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to machine learning with an emphasis on XGBoost and Deep Learning.

### An asynchronous online class

This class is asynchronous meaning there is no mandatory real-time interaction. You will be working through the Inquiryum Machine Learning Fundamentals Course. You can watch the videos anytime you want. You can play them at a faster speed, you can rewatch them or pause them. You can work on  the course material in 20 minute blocks throughout a day, or devote a large contiguous block of time once per week. When you need help you can use the class Slack channel to get assistance from me or your classmates. If you are really stuck we can arrange a screen sharing Zoom call. 

The advantages of this approach is that it allows you great flexibility in when you want to work on the material and for how long. And, as described below under mastery learning, it allows you to work at your own pace.



### Instructor availability

I will be sitting at my laptop on the Slack channel on Monday and Wednesdays from 10am until 2pm and Tuesday, Thursday from 12:30 until 1:45pm.. This means that if you message me, I will respond  immediately unless I am helping another student. Excluding those times, my next level of availability is Monday through Thursday from 11am to 4pm. My average response time during that period is 10 minutes. Feel free to message me outside of those times but my response delay might be significant. Often I turn off Slack notifications at midnight. There may be times during Friday through Sunday when I don't have cell coverage and I will not be able to receive your message. Keep in mind that 

The above hours may be subject to change if other times benefit more students. These changes will be announced in the Slack channel.



## Expected Outcomes

### Basic Machine Learning (ML) Techniques

Students should be able to 

* architect a scalable ML pipeline
* run ML jobs on a GPU using Jupyter Notebooks in Colab
* evaluate different ML models
* determine the best ML algorithm to use for an application
* reduce the dimensionality of a dataset
* develop different linear models to solve classification problems
* communicate effectively about ML applications (terminology)

### XGBoost

Students should be able to

* apply decision tree algorithms to create a classifier
* use random forest techniques
* combine a number of weak classifiers into a strong one by using boosting.
* effectively use the XGBoost algorithm



### Deep Learning

Students should be able to

* build a simple deep learning system for image classification
* build CNNs for computer vision
* pre-process text datasets into a form usable for classification
* build CNN for text classification
* adjust hyperparameters to improve performance



## Labs and Projects

The majority of effort in the course is in working on labs and project, which have different levels of expected knowledge and independence.



### Labs

* In the form of Jupyter Notebook tutorials which provide detailed explanations and sample executable code. 
* You are to:
  * write a small amount of code to complete the task
  * answer any non-coding questions the Notebook may ask.



### Projects

* Follows examples shown in the course videos and in the labs.
* builds off of concepts and skills you learned completing the labs.
* Project definition provides 
  * a dataset
  * a short problem description
* You are to 
  * design and create the machine learning algorithm used to solve the problem.
  * write  the code in a Jupyter Notebook
  * test and evaluate your solution.
  * save your notebook to Github..



## Mastery Learning

Traditional classes are time-based learning. You spend a specific amount of time on a topic and then you move on to the next topic. For example, in a traditional programming course you might cover *while* and *for* loops in week 5, take a quiz on them, and then move on to ArrayLists in week 6. Suppose you got a 75% on that quiz in week 5. That means that you did not learn 25% of the material.  Then perhaps in week 10 you take a test on inheritance and get an 80% (you did not master 20% of the material). These gaps in your mastery start adding up, and eventually, in either in some future class or on the job, you hit a wall because your current task requires that you are skilled in areas that you failed to master. 

This class doesn't work like that.

In contrast to time-based learning,  in mastery Learning you stay on the topic until you master it. You work at your own pace. This online class is based on this approach.  You stay on a topic until you master it.  The lectures are a set of videos (mostly screencasts) that you can watch at anytime. If the material is easy for you, you can speed up the videos and watch them at 1.5 speed. If you find the material challenging, you can rewatch the videos, google for more information, interact with other learners on the Slack channel, or request a private Zoom conference with the instructor. 

Obviously, the work-at-your-own pace approach will collide with the end of the semester and there will be some material that you will not cover. The course is designed so that the essential core information is presented first, to enable you to develop solid foundational skills with no gaps. 



### Mastery Learning Difficulties

This course is work at your own pace. Other courses you might be taking have fixed deadlines, So, for example, you might have a gnarly project for a programming class due this week and a big operating systems project due next week. It is likely that you will work on those projects since they have immediate deadlines and ignore working on this course. It is human nature. To give you some flexibility but to help you stay focused, there will be both recommended and hard deadlines for each project. For example, one project has a recommended deadline of the fourth week of class and a hard deadline of the eighth week.

## Slack 

Slack is a work chat application that many tech companies use. We are going to be using Slack in a number of ways. If you have a particular programming question you can ask it in a general channel and hopefully you will get an answer or suggestion quickly from either myself or fellow learners. 



[Sign up for Slack here](https://join.slack.com/t/umwdatabaseclass/shared_invite/enQtOTAzNzMyNDkyODY0LWRmNzkxYWM2YTM0ZTQ1Y2M5YzZiMGU1NzRmNjEwOGI3ZjMzMzJmNGFhYjdhNTAzM2U0YzM3Y2QwOWFkZmE0MzE).

## Okay but how do I pass?

Grading is based on a method developed by Professor Lee Sheldon at Indiana University. It is based on obtaining experience points (XP). The number of XP determines what level you are at. You start the class at Level Zero and with 0 XP. The level you obtain at the end of the semester determines your final grade. Here is the chart:

| Level |  XP  | Grade |
| :---: | :--: | :---: |
| Zero  |  0   |   F   |
|  One  | 240  |   D   |
|  Two  | 340  |  D+   |
| Three | 450  |  C-   |
| Four  | 550  |   C   |
| Five  | 650  |  C+   |
|  Six  | 750  |  B-   |
| Seven | 850  |   B   |
| Eight | 925  |  B+   |
| Nine  | 1000 |  A-   |
|  Ten  | 1100 |   A   |

Here are the ways of earning XP:

* there will be at least 7 tasks. On average each will be worth 20xp

* there are 6 PostgreSQL projects. Each is worth 100xp

* there is an ElasticSearch project worth 150xp

* the core competency programming challenge is worth 150xp

* the optional oral exam is worth 150xp
